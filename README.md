## Introduction

This is a simple program that gathers and graphs data pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic. Input (using a string) the two countries you would like to compare and you'll soon find out their number of confirmed cases, deaths, recovered pacients, new cases (today's number of pacients - yesterday's) and new deaths.
